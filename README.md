Test Project CMS

This is a test project for Gladeye.

• Basic user account registration/management
• Facebook connectivity and authentication via OAuth
• Programatically sending emails via an SMTP server (i.e. using Gmail server)
• Generating a basic REST endpoint to interface with a database, sending back data as JSON

It is a fast project, without fully test.
The bugs I can assume:
1. edit user details must be edit password
2. Can not get email address from facebook
3. password can be only number
